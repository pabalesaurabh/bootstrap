                    <p> These birds are omnivores. They'll eat seeds and insects but also larger prey like small mice
                        and
                        lizards. 5 ) With 25 billion chickens in the world, there are more of them than any other bird

                <p>Beef is the meat of cattle (Bos taurus). It is categorized as red meat â€” a term used for the meat of
                    mammals, which contains higher amounts of iron than chicken or fish. Usually eaten as roasts, ribs, or
                    steaks, beef is also commonly ground or minced. Patties of ground beef are often used in hamburgers.</p>
